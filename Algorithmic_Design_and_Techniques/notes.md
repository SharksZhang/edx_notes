##2. Algorithmic Warmup
### 2.1 Why Study Algorithms?
#### 2.1.1 Lecture: Why Study Algorithms?

##### Simple Programming Problems

- Has linear scan.
- Cannot do much better.
- The obvious program works.

##### Algorithms Problems

- Not clear how to do
- Simple ideas too slow
- Room for optimization

##### Artificial Intelligence Problems

- Hard to even clearly state.

##### What Weâ€™ll Cover

Focus on algorithms problems.:

- Clearly formulated.

- Hard to do efficiently


#### 2.1.2 Lecture: Coming Up

Cover two algorithm problems:

- Fibonacci Numbers

- Greatest Common Divisors

Examples of why algorithms are important.



Both of these problems have a pretty straightforward algorithm.

These very straightforward algorithms are far, far too slow.



### 2.2 Fibonacci Numbers

Learning Objectives:

- Understand the definition of the Fibonacci numbers.
- Show that the naive algorithm for computing them is slow.
- Efficiently compute large Fibonacci numbers
