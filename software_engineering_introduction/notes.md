## Software Engineering: Introduction

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Welcome 

- what we're going to do is we're going to look at applying software engineering principles
  to large-scale software development.
- The reason software engineering is important in this space is that software engineering gives us
  guidelines to help us plan, design, implement, test, and evolve these software systems over time.
- What software engineering can do then is to help us to reduce the risks of us building the wrong 
- We have something we need to build a system for.How do we go about doing it?
  - **REQUIREMENTS**: first we need to **capture the requirements**. What is it that we actually want to create?
  - **DESIGN**:Then we need to **come up with a design**. What's the high-level structure of the system that we're going to end up building?
  - **BUILD**:the next thing we need to do is actually **build** it. This is the process of writing the program that will implement our system.
  -  **VALIDATE**:Once the system is written, we need to **validate** it and check to make sure it's actually correct and does what we expected it to do.
  - **DEPLOY**:Once our system is good enough, we'll deploy it and put it in front of users for them to try.
  - **MAINTAIN**:We'll have to continually maintain the system and fix the bugs that those users will report to us.
  - **IMPROVE**:we're also going to need to improve the system.
  - **RESEARCH**:So active research is always happening.
