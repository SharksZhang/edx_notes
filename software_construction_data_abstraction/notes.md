## Software Construction: Data Abstraction

### 1. Introduction to Software Construction

#### 1.1 Module Overview

#### **Things you'll learn (without knowing any Java!):**

- How to explore the behaviour and structure of a system
- How to draw a diagram of the relationships between packages and between classes to help your understanding of a totally new system
- Make small changes to a system that you know nothing about, to see if it breaks or changes (this is the beginning of code exploration)

#### 1.2  Welcome

#### 1.3  Walking up to a Codebase: First Look

- To launch an application (execute code) in an IntelliJ project, look for a class that has a play symbol next to it 
- In a Java project, folders are called *packages.* Packages contain classes (each in their own file)  
- To begin to understand a codebase, run the code, and try to relate behaviour in the running code to the names of the Packages and Classes
